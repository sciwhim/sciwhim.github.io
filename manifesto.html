						<h2>Manifesto</h2>
						<br><br>
						<p style = "text-align: left">
						When you are writing code or doing some day to day programming, do you feel like you want to stop thinking about trivial things and focus on influencing the technology's future?
						<br><br>
						$ Welcome to Sciwhim.
						<br><br>
						We like to work on something that doesn't keeps us away from solving challenging problems, creating unbelievable projects and pondering mind blowing algorithms. We like to work on things that can reveal our potential. Programming is not a tool to solve cortically subilluminated problems. It is a tool to create everything from nothing.
						<br><br>
						We are autodidacts. Learning is our oxygen, it lives in the core of our soul and drives us every day.
						<br><br>
						We are not "religious" about programming languages, technologies or tools, all of them have their place.
						<br><br>
						We dream big and have big ideas, which we always transform into goals. Sometimes they might even seem impossible. We keep thinking about them, we make plans to achieve them, and we take action.
						<br><br><br>
						Things that unite us are:
						<br>
						* We rack our minds every day
						<br>
						* We work hard, learn, and research topics we are interested in
						<br>
						* We think about the future from the practical point of view
						<br>
						* We are always searching for answers
						<br>
						* We fail but continue onward
						<br>
						* We want to change the world for the better
						<br>
						* We are open to new crazy absurd-like ideas
						<br><br><br>
						$ Why are we different from other communities?
						<br><br>
						We are all unique. Each of us has fights and stories of ups and downs. Each of us is good at some specific field or topic, different for all of us. We are always learning, studying and researching. When reaching some particular level, being smart and curious - learning becomes harder and harder. While studying the core foundations, questions are mostly trivial and information can be found in books and articles, questions can be answered on Stack Overflow or Quora. But when you are already good at the topic and continue growing, questions become more and more sophisticated and complex. Know the feeling of asking the question on Stack Overflow, having zero answers, having comments like “your question is too broad and isn't going to be easy”, sometimes being marked as “too philosophical”?... It’s when you are pushing the boundaries. Not all the things are answered and described in books, sometimes we have to figure the answers out on our own. What unites us is not the technology and being good at something, always searching for answers, and the lack of people like us to share and discuss our technical worries and questions. You are not alone, believe.
